Chapter 2: Operating-System Structures provides a significantly revised
discussion of the design and implementation of operating systems. We
have updated our treatment of Android and iOS and have revised 
coverage of the system boot process with a focus on GRUB for Linux
systems. New coverage of the Windows subsystem for Linux is included
as well. We have added new sections on linkers and loaders, and we now
discuss why applications are often operating-system specific. Finally, we
have added a discussion of the BCC debugging toolset.
