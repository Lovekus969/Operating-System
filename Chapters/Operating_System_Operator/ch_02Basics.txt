An operating system provides the environment within which programs are
executed. Internally, operating systems vary greatly in their makeup, since they
are organized along many different lines. The design of a new operating system
is a major task. It is important that the goals of the system be well defined
before the design begins. These goals form the basis for choices among various
algorithms and strategies
We can view an operating system from several vantage points. One view
focuses on the services that the system provides; another, on the interface that
it makes available to users and programmers; a third, on its components and
their interconnections. In this chapter, we explore all three aspects of operating
systems, showing the viewpoints of users, programmers, and operating system
designers. We consider what services an operating system provides, how they
are provided, how they are debugged, and what the various methodologies
are for designing such systems. Finally, we describe how operating systems
are created and how a computer starts its operating system
