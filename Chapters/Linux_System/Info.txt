This chapter presents an in-depth examination of the Linux operating system.
By examining a complete, real system, we can see how the concepts we have
discussed relate both to one another and to practice.
Linux is a variant of UNIX that has gained popularity over the last several
decades, powering devices as small as mobile phones and as large as roomfilling supercomputers. In this chapter, we look at the history and development
of Linux and cover the user and programmer interfaces that Linux presents—
interfaces that owe a great deal to the UNIX tradition. We also discuss the design
and implementation of these interfaces. Linux is a rapidly evolving operating
system. This chapter describes developments through the Linux 4.12 kernel,
which was released in 2017.
CHAPTER OBJECTIVES
• Explore the history of the UNIX operating system from which Linux is
derived and the principles upon which Linux’s design is based.
• Examine the Linux process and thread models and illustrate how Linux
schedules threads and provides interprocess communication.
• Look at memory management in Linux.
• Explore how Linux implements file systems and manages I/O devices
