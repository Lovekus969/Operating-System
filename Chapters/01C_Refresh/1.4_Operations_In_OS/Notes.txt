1.4 Operating-System Operations
Now that we have discussed basic information about computer-system organization and architecture, we are ready to talk about operating systems. An operating system provides the environment within which programs are executed.
Internally, operating systems vary greatly, since they are organized along many
different lines. There are, however, many commonalities, which we consider in
this section.

Hadoop (Big Data in Clustered Systems)
  🔹 What is Hadoop?
    “Hadoop is an open-source software framework”
          Open-source → free, community-driven
          Framework → provides tools + architecture, not just one program

    🔹 Purpose of Hadoop
            “used for distributed processing of large data sets (big data)”
                Big data means:
                        Very large volume
                        Too big for a single machine
                        Needs parallel processing
                
                Examples:
                        Logs
                        User activity data
                        Sensor data
                        Social media data
