1.2.2 Storage Structure — Deep System-Level Explanation
  We’ll cover this in layers, from CPU → Memory → Firmware → Storage, and how the OS fits in.
    1️⃣ Fundamental Rule: Where Can the CPU Run Code From?
    
    👉 CPU can execute instructions ONLY from main memory (RAM).
          CPU cannot run programs directly from:
                                                    Hard disk
                                                    SSD
                                                    USB
                                                    EEPROM
          📌 Therefore:
          
          Any program (OS, app, driver) must be loaded into RAM before execution.
      
    2️⃣ Main Memory (RAM)
          🔹 What is Main Memory?
          Also called RAM (Random Access Memory)
          
                                                  Rewritable
                                                  Fast
          Directly accessible by the CPU
          🔹 Technology Used
                      DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory)
                      Needs periodic refreshing
                      Slower than cache, faster than disk
          
          🔹 Role in OS
          
          Holds:
                      Running programs
                      OS kernel
                      Process stacks and heaps
                      Page tables
          
          ⚠️ Volatile
          
          Power off → data lost
