1.2.2 Storage Structure — Deep System-Level Explanation
  We’ll cover this in layers, from CPU → Memory → Firmware → Storage, and how the OS fits in.
    1️⃣ Fundamental Rule: Where Can the CPU Run Code From?
    
    👉 CPU can execute instructions ONLY from main memory (RAM).
          CPU cannot run programs directly from:
                                                    Hard disk
                                                    SSD
                                                    USB
                                                    EEPROM
          📌 Therefore:
          
          Any program (OS, app, driver) must be loaded into RAM before execution.
      
    2️⃣ Main Memory (RAM)
          🔹 What is Main Memory?
          Also called RAM (Random Access Memory)
          
                                                  Rewritable
                                                  Fast
          Directly accessible by the CPU
          🔹 Technology Used
                      DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory)
                      Needs periodic refreshing
                      Slower than cache, faster than disk
          
          🔹 Role in OS
          
          Holds:
                      Running programs
                      OS kernel
                      Process stacks and heaps
                      Page tables
          
          ⚠️ Volatile
          
          Power off → data lost

Storage Hierarchy (Big Picture)
    From fastest & smallest → slowest & largest:

          CPU Registers
          ↓
          CPU Cache (L1, L2, L3)
          ↓
          Main Memory (RAM / DRAM)
          ↓
          Secondary Storage (SSD / HDD)
          ↓
          Tertiary Storage (Cloud / Tape)

4️⃣ Storage INSIDE the CPU (Very Important)
        🔹 1. Registers (Fastest Storage)
        
        Located inside CPU
                  Very small
                  Extremely fast
        
        Types:
            Program Counter (PC)
            Instruction Register (IR)
            General-purpose registers
            Stack pointer
            Status register
        
        📌 Used for:
        
            Current instruction
            Intermediate calculations
            Control flow
        🔹 2. CPU Cache
            Between CPU and RAM to reduce access time.
            Cache Level	Location	Speed
            L1	Inside core	Fastest
            L2	Per core	Fast
            L3	Shared	Slower
        
        Cache stores:
            Frequently used instructions
            Frequently used data
        📌 OS impact:
        
        Cache coherence in multiprocessor systems
        Performance optimization

5️⃣ Why Not Run OS from RAM Only?
          Because RAM is volatile.
    
            ❌ Power off → OS gone
            ❌ Bootstrap code lost
    So we need nonvolatile storage.

6️⃣ Firmware Storage (EEPROM & ROM)

              🔹 What is Firmware?
                      Small programs stored in nonvolatile memory Used to start the system
          Stored in:
                    EEPROM
                    Flash memory
                    ROM (older systems)
        
        🔹 EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM)
        
        Characteristics:
                    Nonvolatile
                    Writable (but rarely written)
                    Retains data without power
        
        Used to store:
                  Bootstrap loader
                  Hardware initialization code
                  BIOS / UEFI
        
        📌 Why EEPROM?
                  Reliable
                  Not erased on shutdown
                  Perfect for startup code
