A large portion of operating system code is dedicated to managing I/O, both
because of its importance to the reliability and performance of a system and
because of the varying nature of the devices
  What is DMA (Direct Memory Access)?
   DMA = a hardware mechanism that allows an I/O device to transfer data directly to/from main memory without CPU involvement for every byte.
🔹 1️⃣ Interrupt-Driven I/O (Small Data)
      “The form of interrupt-driven I/O described in Section 1.2.1 is fine for moving small amounts of data”
      Meaning:
                Keyboard input
                Mouse movement
                Single characters
      
      📌 These devices:
                Transfer 1 byte or few bytes
                Generate few interrupts
                Overhead is acceptable

🔹 2️⃣ Problem with Bulk Data (NVS / Disk I/O)
“but can produce high overhead when used for bulk data movement such as NVS I/O”
      Why overhead is high:
                Disk transfers thousands / millions of bytes
                Interrupt per byte = ❌ disaster
      📌 CPU must:
                Save context
                Handle interrupt
                Copy data
                Resume process
➡️ Repeating this for every byte kills performance.

🔹 3️⃣ Solution → DMA (Direct Memory Access)
      “To solve this problem, direct memory access (DMA) is used.”
      DMA is designed specifically for large data transfers:
              Disk
              Network
              USB
              GPU
