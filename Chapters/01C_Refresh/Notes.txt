Chapter 1: Introduction includes updated coverage of multicore systems,
as well as new coverage of NUMA systems and Hadoop clusters. Old
material has been updated, and new motivation has been added for the
study of operating systems.

What is a Multiprocessor System?

A multiprocessor system is a computer that has more than one CPU.
  Examples:
      Smartphones (multiple cores)
      Laptops / desktops (quad-core, octa-core CPUs)
      Servers (many CPUs)
  
  Earlier computers had one CPU → now multiple CPUs or cores are the norm.

Why use multiple processors? (Main Advantage)
    Throughput = amount of work done per unit time
    More CPUs → more tasks can run at the same time

Example:
    1 CPU → 1 task at a time
    4 CPUs → up to 4 tasks at the same time
        So overall work finishes faster
