In Section 1.2, we introduced the general structure of a typical computer system. A computer system can be organized in a number of different ways,
which we can categorize roughly according to the number of general-purpose processors used.

What is a Single-Processor System?
  A single-processor system has only one general-purpose CPU capable of executing user processes.
📌 Key idea:
        Only ONE CPU executes instructions at any instant
        Many programs may appear to run at once → illusion created by OS

        It means:
Only one CPU executes user instructions
Other processors may exist but are special-purpose
