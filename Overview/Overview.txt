 Overview. Chapters 1 and 2 explain what operating systems are, what
they do, and how they are designed and constructed. These chapters discuss what the common features of an operating system are and what an
operating system does for the user. We include coverage of both traditional PC and server operating systems and operating systems for mobile
devices. The presentation is motivational and explanatory in nature. We
have avoided a discussion of how things are done internally in these chapters. Therefore, they are suitable for individual readers or for students in
lower-level classes who want to learn what an operating system is without
getting into the details of the internal algorithms.
