 What is an Operating System (OS)?
    Simple definition (exam-ready):
        An Operating System is a program that acts as an interface between the user and the hardware.

Without OS:
          No programs
          No files
          No keyboard / mouse handling
          No multitasking
]Why Do We Need an OS?

Hardware alone cannot:
        Run multiple programs
        Manage memory
        Decide which program runs next
        Protect programs from each other

Two Worlds: User Space & Kernel Space
    This is THE MOST IMPORTANT OS CONCEPT.
🔵 User Space

        Where your programs run
        Limited access
        Cannot directly touch hardware

Examples:
        
        Your C program
        Browser
        Text editor

🔴 Kernel Space
        Where OS runs
        Full access to hardware
        Manages CPU, memory, devices

Examples:
        
        Process manager
        Memory manager
        File system
        Device drivers

Q  How User Talks to OS → System Calls ?
   User programs cannot directly access hardware.

New Coverage: Hadoop Clusters

What is a Cluster?
        Many computers connected via network
        Work together as one system
Hadoop Cluster

Used for:
        Big data processing
        Distributed storage
        Fault tolerance
Why Do We Need Dual-Mode Operation?
The operating system (OS) and user programs both use:
        CPU
        Memory
        I/O device
        Files

⚠️ Problem:

A buggy or malicious user program could:
        Access memory it shouldn’t
        Crash the OS
        Take control of hardware

📌 OS role in clusters:

        Process coordination
        Resource management
        Distributed file systems
