What is an Operating System (OS)?
    Simple definition (exam-ready):
        An Operating System is a program that acts as an interface between the user and the hardware.

Without OS:
          No programs
          No files
          No keyboard / mouse handling
          No multitasking
]Why Do We Need an OS?

Hardware alone cannot:
        Run multiple programs
        Manage memory
        Decide which program runs next
        Protect programs from each other
