 Multimode Operation in Modern CPUs (Article Study)

Why Go Beyond Dual-Mode?
Earlier we saw:
    User mode → limited privileges
    Kernel mode → full control

Modern systems are more complex:
                              Device drivers
                              Virtual machines
                              Hypervisors
                              Secure firmware

👉 Two modes are sometimes not enough.
So CPUs provide multiple execution modes with different privilege levels.

2️⃣ Intel x86 Protection Rings
    Intel processors implement 4 protection rings 
| Ring   | Privilege Level | Typical Use        |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Ring 0 | Highest         | Kernel (OS core)   |
| Ring 1 | High            | OS services (rare) |
| Ring 2 | Medium          | OS services (rare) |
| Ring 3 | Lowest          | User applications  |

In practice:

Ring 0 → Operating System kernel
Ring 3 → User programs
Rings 1 & 2 → Mostly unused

📌 Why unused?

            Simpler OS design
            Performance reasons
            Modern OSs prefer kernel/user split
